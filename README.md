Site is expected to be minimalist. Keep clutter minimal, each element should have a purpose.

## Grading items

### Minimal Requirements
* Minimalistic design
* A section to hold the quotes
* A button to generate a new quote
* A button to share the quote to a social media page (must work)

### Quote sources:
* For minimal grade the quotes do not have to come from a remote API. see additional challenges.

### Additional Challenges
* Source should come from a quote API. No further requirements on what kind of quotes come from the API
* Add a second social media share button that works.

### Hacker Challenges
#### Level 1
* Give some sort of design flair for when the user generates a quote. Be creative.
* Quote api should have some sort of theme and have your site reflect that theme.

#### Level 2 option a
* Create a second generate button that will pull from a separate source for a different type of quote.
* Theme of the site should change to reflect the quote source.

#### Level 2 option b
* Add a text field. Allow the user to enter a topic or keyword that the api will use to generate a quote based on the word(s) entered.
* This will involve finding an API that allows this and what can be entered will be based on the API.
* Text field should have validation on it or at least provide an error if the item entered returned no quote results
